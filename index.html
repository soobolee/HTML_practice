The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the <strong><u>Web</u></strong>, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators, which may be interlinked by hyperlinks,<br>and are accessible over the Internet. <p>The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server. The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and upon which technologies the Web is built.</p>
